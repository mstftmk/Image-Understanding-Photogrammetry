# Image Understanding / Photogrammetry Course - Homeworks & Lab Notebooks

This repository contains the homeworks and lab notebooks I completed during my master's degree course in "Image Understanding" (equivalent to Photogrammetry). The course, taught by **Assoc. Professor Mustafa Ã–zuysal** from **Izmir Institute of Technology**, focuses on image processing techniques and methodologies for analyzing image content, as well as key geometric and mathematical concepts relevant to computer vision.


## Course Overview

The "Image Understanding" course covers the following topics:

- **Image Representation**: Memory structures for image data, pixel-based representations.
- **Basic Image Processing**: Image filtering, enhancement, and transformations.
- **Advanced Image Processing**: Algorithms for noise reduction, edge detection, and feature extraction.
- **Keypoint Detection and Matching**: Techniques such as SIFT, SURF, and ORB for feature extraction and matching between images.
- **Planar Projective Geometry**: Understanding image transformations in planar spaces.
- **3D Projective Geometry**: Representation of 3D scenes and transformations between different views.
- **Basic Camera Geometry**: Fundamentals of camera models and image formation.
- **Epipolar Geometry**: Understanding camera relations and constraints between two views.
- **Optimization Techniques**: Techniques for refining camera models and improving feature matches.
- **Multiview Geometry**: Handling multiple views for 3D scene reconstruction.
- **Dense Image Features**: Algorithms for computing dense features in images.
- **Object Category Detection**: Techniques for detecting object categories from image data.

## Structure of the Repository

The repository is organized into folders for homeworks and lab notebooks based on the main topics of the course:

- **Homeworks/**: Contains the assignments I completed, covering theoretical questions and practical tasks.
- **Lab Notebooks/**: Includes Jupyter notebooks (or other format) used during the course labs for hands-on experiments in image processing and analysis.

Each folder contains a detailed description of the tasks, algorithms implemented, and results.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mstftmk/Image-Understanding-Photogrammetry.git
   cd Image-Understanding-Photogrammetry

2. Navigate to the relevant homework or lab notebook folder for the desired topic.

3. Follow the instructions within each notebook or homework folder for setup and execution details.

## Prerequisites
